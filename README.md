For this project i built a Neural network to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat using a State-of-the-Art CNN model
        <ul align='left'>
        <li>Image Preprocessing</li>
        <li>Transfer learning on a CNN trained on inceptionV3 architecture.</li>
        <li>I was able to get the model to predict the pet(cat or dog) with 96.4% accuracy. </li>
        <li>Tested with my pets!</li>
